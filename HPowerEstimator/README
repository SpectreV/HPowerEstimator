************************************************

This is Hierarchical FPGA Power Estimator, which provide extreme flexibility for
users to define and calculation power consumption of any components defined in 
a FPGA architecture. This tool is based on VPR 6.0.

* Build HPowerEstimator

	#:~/Downloads$ tar fvxz HPowerEstimator.tar.gz
	#:~/Downloads$ mv HPowerEstimator /path/to/HPowerEstimator && cd /path/to/HPowerEstimator
	#:/path/to/HPowerEstimator$ make

For those who have installed VPR 6.0 before, no need for extra packages.
For those who haven't, install the following packages:
Ubuntu example
	#:~$ sudo apt-get install ctags flex bison libx11-dev g++


* Run HPowerEstimator

We provide a convenient bash script to run all the blif benchmarks in the 
vtr_flow/benchmarks/blif directory provided by VPR.

	#:/path/to/HPowerEstimator$ ./power.sh

For those who need to estimate power consumption of a custom blif benchmark, please
follow the instructions:
	
Ubuntu example
	#:/path/to/HPowerEstimator$ ace2/ace -b /path/to/blif_file -b /path/to/new/blif_file -o /path/to/activity_file
	#:/path/to/HPowerEstimator$ vpr/vpr vpr/sample_arch.xml /path/to/new/blif_file -power --activity_file /path/to/activity_file --power_lib power_lib.xml

Make sure your blif file is compatible with VPR itself. Power library will be discussed below.
 

* How to use and define power library

We provided a power library example which is compatible with the sample_arch.xml architecture in the vpr folder. 
The basic principle of building your own power library is quite simple:
	
	#Every pb_type defined in the architecture should have a 
         corresponding pb_power in the power library

	#Power of the pb_type can be calculated in three ways: 
		"sum_of_children"
	 	"ignore"
		"macro"

	#For power_method="ignore", the children pb_types of the 
	 corresponding pb_type don't need corresponding pb_power sections

	#For power_method="sum_of_children", please specify the 
	 corresponding pb_power sections for ALL children pb_types
	 of ALL modes in the architecture file  

	#For power_method="macro", please specify the "dynamic_power_constant" and
	 "static_power_matrix" of this pb_type. "dynamic_power_constant" is the average
	 power consumption of this pb_type at the frequency of "at_freq" with input nodes
	 switching activity equals 100%, "static_power_matrix" is the power matrix for 
	 different types of input vectors as the input of this pb_type. Currently we
	 only support a constant(average) static power consumption value.
